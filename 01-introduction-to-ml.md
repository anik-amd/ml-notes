# What is Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of science that deals with algorithms and systems performing specific tasks using patterns and interface, rather than explicitly programmed instructions.

Two types of machine learning:

**01. Supervised Learning:** Labeled data is used to train a model.

**02. Unsupervised Learning:** Unlabeled data is used to train a model.

# ML vs. AI vs. data science

Artificial intelligence deals with any technique that allows machines to display "intelligence", similar to humans. Machine learning is one of the main techniques used to create artificial intelligence, but other non-ML techniques (e.g., alpha-beta pruning, rule-based systems) are also widely used in AI.

On the other hand, data science deals with gathering insights from datasets.

# 7 Steps of the ML process

**01. Data Collection**

**02. Data Processing & Preparation**

**03. Feature Engineering:** Transform or drop some features of data.

**04. Model Selection:** This is one of the main tasks of industry engineers. Rather than attempting to come up with a completely novel model architecture, most tasks can be thoroughly performed with an existing architecture (or combination of model architectures).

**05. Model Training & Data Pipeline:** After selecting the model architecture, you will create a data pipeline for training the model. This means creating a continuous stream of batched data observations to efficiently train the model. Since training can take a long time, you want your data pipeline to be as efficient as possible.

**06. Model Validation**

**07. Model Persistence:** This means setting up a process with which new users can easily use your pre-trained model to make predictions.
