# Data analysis

Before doing any task with a dataset, it is a good idea to perform preliminary data analysis. Data analysis allows us to understand the dataset, find potential outlier values, and figure out which features of the dataset are most important to our application.

- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a Python library that provides data structures and data analysis tools. It is built on top of NumPy and Matplotlib.

- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is a Python library that provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.
