# Data Processing

People normally discuss the importance of data in the context of machine learning. No matter how sophisticated a machine learning model is, it will not perform well unless it has a reasonable amount of data to train on. On the other hand, given a large and diverse set of training data, a good deep learning model will significantly outperform non-deep-learning
algorithms.

The universal usage of data makes data processing, the act of converting raw data into a meaningful form, an essential skill to have.

# NumPy

When we deal with numeric data, the best Python library to use is NumPy. The NumPy library allows us to perform many operations on numeric data and convert the data to more usable forms.
